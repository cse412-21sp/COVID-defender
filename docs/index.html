When the first round of vaccines began to roll out in December 2020 for those at most risk to COVID, 
it signaled the beginning of the end of mandated masks and remote-learning. Washington State’s Governer
Inslee announced school reopening plans to have every school offer at least partial in-person learning
by April 2021. All schools shifted to offer at least a hybrid model mix of in-person and remote learning 
for students at every school level in the following months, with many school districts exceeding expectations
by having complete in-person attendence.</p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
The area chart shows the overall population of in-person attendence compared to enrollment at Elementary, Middle School, and High School levels for Washington State.
Since initial plans were put into effect to shift learning back to in-person, there has been a gradual increase in population of in-person attendence across
all school levels.<iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Book_16216477449480/AttendenceandEnrollmentOverTimeAcrossSchoolLevels?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="400"></iframe></p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
All school levels experienced similar increase percentage to in-person attendence between the months of January to April. Elementary school level has the greatest
percentage of in-person attendence both before and after initiating plans to shift more students to in-person learning. This is followed by middle schools, with in-person attendence
at the high school level being the lowest. This trend is seen due to experienced educators determining that in-person learning is more crucial for students
at the elementary level for their learning development.<iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Book_16216477449480/In-PersonAttendenceOverTimeAcrossSchoolLevels?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="400"></iframe></p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
The maps of Washington State’s school district boundaries gives insights into each school district’s shift towards in-person attendence. Direct comparisons in rate of in-person attendence
between the months January and April can be seen by toggling between the data for the two dates.</p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
Overall, there is greater in-person attendence in school districts located in Eastern Washington, compared to the West.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="fullWidth"><div class="map"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Book_16216477449480/In-PersonAttendenceComparison?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="800"></iframe></div></div><div class="fullWidth"><div class="map"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Book_16216477449480/In-PersonAttendenceatDifferrentSchoolLevels?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="600"></iframe></div></div><div class="fullWidth"><div class="map"><h3 id="in-may-2021,-washington-state’s-governer-inslee-announced-plans-to-have-all-schools-completely-reopen-by-fall-2021-for-the-new-school-year.">In May <!-- -->2<!-- -->0<!-- -->2<!-- -->1<!-- -->, Washington State’s Governer Inslee announced plans to have all schools completely reopen by Fall <!-- -->2<!-- -->0<!-- -->2<!-- -->1 <!-- -->for the new school year.</h3><h3 id="as-more-students-travel-to-school-due-to-in-person-learning,-one-should-expect-transportation-levels-to-return-to-normal.">As more students travel to school due to in-person learning, one should expect transportation levels to return to normal.</h3></div></div><div class="article-header" style="background:black;color:white"><h1 class="hed">Transportation</h1></div><div class="idyll-scroll" id="idyll-scroll-1" style="position:relative"><div class="idyll-scroll-graphic" style="top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:auto;width:100%;transform:translate3d(0, 0, 0);z-index:-1;height:0"><div style="width:0;position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:50%;transform:translateY(-50%)"><div><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/final_prelim_vis/Sheet1?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="800"></iframe></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><div class="idyll-scroll-text"><div class="idyll-step "><p>
We see from the line graph displaying the trends in people staying at home/not staying at home in Washington State that before COVID-19, the total population staying at home did not fluctate greatly day to day. </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
However, we see that shortly after 2020, the trends changed drastically as when all schools closed the total population who stayed at home drastically increased in the following days. </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
This can be explained by the lack of trips made to schools by students and parents since it was announced that schools were closed. </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
Since those increases/decreases, the total population staying at home remained relatively constant daily until vaccinations became available. </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
When vaccinations became available, the total population who did stay at home started to gradually decrease daily, as vaccinations meant that more people could go out safely with little chance of being infected with COVID-19. </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
With the current trends, it appears more and more people are no longer fearing COVID-19 due to the vaccine.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="fullWidth"><div class="stepper"><div class="idyll-stepper" style="position:relative;height:500px"><div class="idyll-step-graphic"></div><div class="idyll-step-content"><div class="idyll-step "><iframe width="100%" height="600" frameBorder="0" src="https://observablehq.com/embed/d760f7f8e307d846?cells=all"></iframe><h3 id="this-graph-shows-the-overall-distances-traveled.-however,-more-insights-can-be-gained-by-filtering-down-to-ranges-of-distances.">This graph shows the overall distances traveled.

Furthermore, Alaska seemed to gain a promising lead, but fell the rankings around the beginning of May.  Later, it becomes clear the the Republic of Palau is the dominent winner, and thus is the safest place to travel as the pandemic comes to an end.  However, revealing such locations could be paradoxical, as one might expect an influx of travelers due to apparent safety, so it would not be surpising if the Republic of Palua loses the record for having <!-- -->0 <!-- -->reported cases.</h3></div></div><div class="idyll-scroll" id="idyll-scroll-2" style="position:relative"><div class="idyll-scroll-graphic" style="top:0;left:0;right:0;bottom:auto;width:100%;transform:translate3d(0, 0, 0);z-index:-1;height:0"><div style="width:0;position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:50%;transform:translateY(-50%)"><div><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/USPopulationVaccinated/PopulationVaccinatedUS?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link?:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="800"></iframe></div></div></div><div class=" idyll-text-container"><div class="idyll-scroll-text"><div class="idyll-step "><p>
    This final graph serves as a reminder that the rollout of the vaccine is still in its early stages.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
	Showing states with less than 50% of their population vaccinated in orange, and over 50% in blue, the number of states with a majority of the population vaccinated is extremely small.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
	We still cannot rely on herd immunity to protect the young and elderly from COVID-19, so despite all the positive upward trends in the visualizations that you have seen today, the pandemic is far from over.
  </p></div><div class="idyll-step "><p>
	If anything, the upward trends in school enrollement and travel are concerning, so please remember to practice all health guidelines, stay home whenever possible, and to get vaccinated - otherwise, we may need to spend additional time learning remotely next school year...
